    {
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Prevent additional 30k inauthentic signups/day by by retraining inauthentic account classifier. Automate retraining to periodically refresh model.
        \item Improve observability/maintainability of inauthentic account classifier by migrating from on-prem to Dataflow
        \item Quantify impact of future project that would increase detection of inauthentic accounts by 50%
        \item Improve observability of account remediation systems and enforce quality standards by implementing monitoring system
      \end{itemize}

    {April 2021}
    {
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Reduce 80\% of engineering intervention in topic classifier retraining by refactoring training pipeline
        \item Improve observability of topic classification model by automating model evaluation
        \item Improve long-term model reliability by delivering PoC and migration plan  for using kubeflow/Vertex AI to train/serve models
        \item Improve team throughput by onboarding and mentoring 7 new engineers (doubling the team size) after a funding round
      \end{itemize}

    {
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Remove 85M  non-business-related IPs/month from B2B intent analysis using IP behavior based spark.ml classifier
        \item Increase company resolution (from IP addresses) by 200\% using IP behavior based spark.ml classifier
        \item Reduce model deployment time by 75\% by building model development lifecycle tooling/standards
        \item Improve accuracy of topic classification (used to determine B2B interest in topics) by 20\% by migrating legacy NLP classifier (fasttext) to BERT-based model (PyTorch/spaCy/huggingface)
        \item Improve observability of model performance by setting up model store/dashboard (mlflow)
        \item  Build labeling system (using Heartex) to improve labels for content-type model, resulting in 20\% better accuracy. Labelling tool was utilized by multiple teams for other models.

    {June 2017}
    {
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Improved accuracy of content extraction (used for topic classification of web content) by migrating to a ML library (dragnet) (ported to Python 3)
        \item Filter Prevent web requests to 9.5M URLs/month not meant to be requested (as specified in their robots.txt) using a GKE-based url filtering application
        \item Refactor/optimize spark-based analytics pipeline, reducing job failures 50\% and runtime by 75\%
        \item Increase developer velocity by building internal tooling (for automatic documentation builds (Sphinx), Python packaging, and GCP workflows
      \end{itemize}
